# ARCANA - Activity Recognition and Cardiology ANAlysis

<b> Objective: </b> Activity recognition and cardiology analysis

<b> Functional Requirements: </b>
1. Login
2. Collect user cell accelerometer and gyroscope data and compare with dataset to recognize activities
3. Collect heartbeat data
4. Start activity tracking
5. Register new activity
	- Save data log
	- Analyze data for activity base composition for analysis with threshold algorithm
	- Adapt system to verify similar activity using threshold algorithm
6. Confirm monitored activity
	- If the activity is confirmed as wrong, request registration of a new activity
7. Alert (text and sound) unusual heartbeat situation
	- Alarm features must be adapted according to battery level
8. Save History
	- Save logs when activity occurred
	- Save heartbeat level throughout the day
9. Display heartbeat history
